# BattleJar Client

BattleJar Client is the client implementation for the BattleJar Universe game engine, built with Java 25.

## Project Structure

- `api`: Basic set of models used by the `battle.jar` server.
- `client`: A very basic client, partially generated by an AI, to simplify commander development. The communication between the client and the server has some flaws and will be improved in the future as part of an exercise. Till the 1.0.0 version is released, the client should be considered unstable and even minor versions may contain breaking changes.
- `math`: Math utilities. It's an almost exact copy of the [math package from the libgdx repository](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/math) (TODO: check if it can be replaced with [gdx-math](https://github.com/mini2Dx/gdx-math)). The project was originally a libgdx project.

## Building and Installation

### Build the project
To build the project and run tests, use:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Install to mavenLocal
To install the artifacts to your local Maven repository, run:
```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

## Gradle

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.
The Gradle wrapper was included, so you can run Gradle tasks using `gradlew.bat` or `./gradlew` commands.
Useful Gradle tasks and flags:

- `--continue`: when using this flag, errors will not stop the tasks from running.
- `--daemon`: thanks to this flag, Gradle daemon will be used to run chosen tasks.
- `--offline`: when using this flag, cached dependency archives will be used.
- `--refresh-dependencies`: this flag forces validation of all dependencies. Useful for snapshot versions.
- `build`: builds sources and archives of every project.
- `cleanEclipse`: removes Eclipse project data.
- `cleanIdea`: removes IntelliJ project data.
- `clean`: removes `build` folders, which store compiled classes and built archives.
- `eclipse`: generates Eclipse project data.
- `idea`: generates IntelliJ project data.
- `test`: runs unit tests.

Note that most tasks that are not specific to a single project can be run with `name:` prefix, where the `name` should be replaced with the ID of a specific project.
For example, `client:clean` removes `build` folder only from the `client` project.
